# Compline - A Colorscheme for Deep Contemplation and Work

From the Latin "completorium" - completion.  The final prayer of the Catholic Liturgical Hours, a time for deep contemplation, to be at peace with the darkness.

Compline is meant to be the embodiment of this - taking minimalism to a monastic extent, where colors are expressions of the same tone, a suggestion rather than something that shouts to the user.

## The Motivation
For many years, I have used Nord as my default colorscheme for all my work and day to day

Compline is a homage to Nord, Everforest, and the monotone colorscheme - reducing saturation and building from one tone, stripping everything away that is not essential.
